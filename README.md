# Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine the best weather time for a surf and ice cream shop business. Using Jupyter Notebook and SQLite we can analyze the weather data trends to choose the best month option between June and December. 

# Results
- The average temperature difference between June(75) and December(71) is 4 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning June is a bit warmer than December.
- There's only a 2 degrees maximum temperature difference between June(85) and December(83).
- There's a bigger difference of 8 degrees between June(64) and December(56) for minimum temperature.

# Summary
After comparing the summary statistics for June and December, we can conclude June's slightly warmer weather will be the best outcome for the business. Although the stats for June and December are similar, December's lowest weather temperatures could have a negative impact on the surf and ice cream shop.The plotted histograms better visualize the weather difference between both months.
